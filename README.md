## API Endpoints

- `POST /api/receipts/process` — upload and process a receipt image
- `GET /api/receipts` — list recent receipts
- `GET /api/receipts/{receipt_id}` — fetch a specific receipt record
- `GET /api/receipts/summary?period=week|month` — spending summary

## Example Parsed Receipt JSON

```json
{
	"store_name": "Costco",
	"date": "2026-02-26",
	"tax": 3.75,
	"total": 54.74,
	"items": [
		{
			"name": "Bananas",
			"quantity": 1,
			"price": 2.99
		}
	]
}
```

Install from: https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract

### 3) Create virtual environment and install Python dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4) Configure Gemini key

Set your API key as an environment variable:

```bash
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_key_here"
```

### 5) Run the app

## Notes

- Keep receipts flat and well-lit for best OCR accuracy.
- The app stores receipt data in `receipts.db` (created automatically).
- Uploaded images are saved in `uploads/`.

## Security Reminder

If an API key was posted publicly during collaboration, rotate it immediately and replace it with a new key.
